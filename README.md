# SAKILA-DATABASE
A Project Displaying the Analystical Prowess From Data Modelling to Visualization

The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided 

What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. Object-relational databases use a hybrid approach to databases.

In object databases, information is stored as objects, much like object-oriented programming.
In relational databases, information is stored in tables with relationships between tables defined by primary and foreign keys.
Importantly, PostgreSQL allows the use of advanced functions (such as Window Functions), and even development and use of custom functions written in different programming languages. Here is a link to better understand what is meant by an object-relational database, and how it differs from a relational database.
